Per USC ID, I am assigned Yahoo search engine.

Average Percent Overlap - 7.9
Average Spearman Coefficient - 4.18

Comparing Yahoo results to Google, we can say that yahoo results have a minimal overlap with google results. 
Maximum overlaps is only 4 for Query 58 and Query 100.
Spearman Coefficient is negative most of the cases suggesting very less overlap between the results.
This indicates that google and yahoo use different search algorithms to get matching result for a query.
Also, they use different ranking algorithm to rank the fetched results.
